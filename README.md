# Arduweather
I'd Certainly like a way of telling the temperature and other conditions on my deck. I could just by a Thermometer, but where is the fun in that? Wouldn't it be more cool if I had a bunch of sensors hooked up to an Arduino, spewing data into a database on my raspi? That seems like the least time consuming and expensive way to solve my problem.
